## üèÅ CONCLUSION

The separate registration tables implementation provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for handling different types of user registrations. Each registration type now has its own dedicated table that captures all the data from the frontend forms, making it easy to manage, query, and extend the system as needed.

**Current Status**: 70% Complete
- ‚úÖ Database schema and models
- ‚úÖ Repository interfaces  
- ‚úÖ Pet owner registration service and controller
- ‚úÖ Frontend API integration
- ‚è≥ Remaining: Complete other services and controllers

The foundation is solid and the remaining work follows the same patterns already established, making completion straightforward and consistent.
