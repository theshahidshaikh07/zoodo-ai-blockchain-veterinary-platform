Is building a final-year project called 'Zoodo' â€” an AI- and blockchain-powered veterinary care and community platform with roles for Pet Owners, Doctors (vets), Trainers, Admin, Organizations (companies, trusts, NGOs), and Hospitals/Clinics. It will use Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker Compose for containerization. The platform is a web-based intelligent pet care platform aiming to create a unified digital ecosystem for pet owners, veterinary professionals, trainers, and welfare communities. It offers multi-modal veterinary appointments (clinic, home visit, telemedicine), trainer consultations, pet profile management, and secure Digital Health Records (DHRs). An AI module provides symptom-based triage and personalized care recommendations, while blockchain ensures transparent and immutable medical data storage. Zoodo includes a Community Hub for adoption, donations, and local events. It is built using a modular, microservices architecture for scalability, security, and role-based access. Doctors and trainers offer services via home visit, telemedicine, and clinic/academy modes. The frontend is hosted on Vercel's free tier, with environment-based configurations. The admin interface is implemented as a separate `/admin` route, and role-based registration flows are being designed for clarity and personalization. The project prioritizes enterprise-level scalability while managing practical constraints during development. User wants honest, structured, and security-conscious solutions.


Zoodo is an AI- and blockchain-powered veterinary care and community platform. Key entities and their purposes:

Entities:
1. Pet Owner (User): Book appointments, manage pets, access medical records, join events.
2. Doctor (Vet): Offers medical services (home visit, telemedicine, clinic-based). Can be individual, own clinic, or hospital affiliated.
3. Trainer: Offers training services (home visit, tele-training, academy). Can be individual, own academy, or part of academy/organization.
4. Clinic/Hospital: Treated as one entity 'Facility' with type field (clinic/hospital). Doctors/trainers can affiliate with multiple facilities.
5. Organization (NGO, Trust, Company): External entities that organize events like adoption, donations, and awareness campaigns.
6. Community Hub: Managed by Zoodo admin, aggregates events, adoption posts, donation drives, webinars, and interactions across all roles.

Hierarchy & Flow:
- Admin (Zoodo) oversees all.
- Users (pet owners) consume services.
- Doctors affiliated with Facilities.
- Trainers affiliated with Academies/Organizations.
- Organizations post events linked to Community Hub.
- Users join events, book services, and view Digital Health Records (DHRs).

Key Notes:
- Doctors and Trainers can operate individually without facilities.
- Facilities include attributes: type (clinic/hospital), ownership (individual/group/organization), location, capacity, departments.
- Roles, workflows, and hierarchy designed for scalability and microservices architecture.
- Community Hub is the engagement layer, while organizations are external collaborators.
