## 📡 API Endpoints

### POST `/api/v1/chat`
Main chat endpoint for conversing with Salus AI.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "My dog is vomiting and won't eat",
  "session_id": "frontend_session_123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "response": "I'm sorry to hear your dog isn't feeling well. Vomiting and loss of appetite can indicate several conditions...",
    "is_emergency": false,
    "emergency_severity": "normal",
    "session_id": "frontend_session_123456",
    "message_count": 2,
    "pet_context": {}
  }
}
```

**Emergency Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "response": "⚠️ EMERGENCY: Your dog's symptoms indicate a serious condition...",
    "is_emergency": true,
    "emergency_severity": "high",
    "suggested_actions": [
      {
        "type": "connect_vet_online",
        "label": "Connect with Vet Online",
        "priority": "high"
      },
      {
        "type": "find_vet_nearby",
        "label": "Find Vet Clinic Nearby",
        "priority": "high"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/v1/nutrition`

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

The frontend is already set up to work with Salus AI. The integration is in:
- `frontend/src/app/ai-assistant/page.tsx` - Main chat interface
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - API service (updated to use `/api/v1/chat`)

### How It Works

1. **User sends message** → Frontend calls `/api/v1/chat`
2. **Session management** → Creates/retrieves session
3. **Emergency detection** → Checks for urgent keywords
4. **RAG search** → Searches datasets for relevant context
5. **AI generation** → Gemini generates response with context
6. **Response** → Returns AI response with metadata

### Emergency Handling in Frontend

When `is_emergency: true`:
- Display emergency warning
- Show action buttons:
  - "Connect with Vet Online"
  - "Find Vet Clinic Nearby"
- Highlight the message differently

## 🧪 Testing Examples

### Test 1: Normal Conversation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What should I feed my puppy?", "session_id": "test_123"}'
```

### Test 2: Emergency Detection
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "My dog can'\''t breathe and is turning blue!", "session_id": "test_123"}'
```

### Test 3: Symptom Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "My cat is scratching her ears a lot", "session_id": "test_123"}'
```

### Test 4: Nutrition Advice
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/nutrition \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "test_123",
    "pet_type": "dog",
    "breed": "Labrador",
    "age": "puppy",
    "weight": 15
  }'
```

## 🎯 Conversation Flow Examples

### Example 1: Progressive Information Collection

**User:** "My dog seems sick"

**Salus AI:** "I'm sorry to hear your dog isn't feeling well. I'm here to help. What's your dog's name?"

**User:** "Max"

**Salus AI:** "Thanks! What symptoms is Max showing? For example, is he vomiting, having diarrhea, not eating, or something else?"

**User:** "He's been vomiting"

**Salus AI:** "I understand. To help Max better, could you tell me his age and breed?"

### Example 2: Emergency Detection

**User:** "My dog ate chocolate and is shaking!"

**Salus AI:** "⚠️ EMERGENCY: Chocolate toxicity is a serious emergency in dogs. Here's what you need to do RIGHT NOW:

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Do NOT induce vomiting unless directed by a vet
2. Note the type and amount of chocolate consumed
3. Contact your vet or emergency clinic IMMEDIATELY

**Why This Is Urgent:**
Chocolate contains theobromine, which is toxic to dogs. Shaking indicates the toxin is affecting the nervous system.

**What to Expect:**
The vet may induce vomiting, give activated charcoal, or provide supportive care.

Please seek veterinary care immediately. Would you like me to help you find a nearby emergency vet clinic?"

[Shows buttons: "Connect with Vet Online" | "Find Vet Clinic Nearby"]

### Example 3: Scope Limitation

**User:** "What's the weather today?"

**Salus AI:** "I'm Salus AI, specialized in pet health and care. I can only help with questions about your pets. How can I assist with your pet's health today?"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
**Solution:** Ensure `.env` file exists with valid API key

### Issue: Dataset loading errors
**Solution:** Verify CSV files exist in `datasets/01_raw_data/`

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution:** Check frontend URL is in allowed origins (main.py)

### Issue: Frontend can't connect
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure AI service is running on port 8000
2. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_SERVICE_URL` in frontend `.env.local`

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Response Time:** ~2-5 seconds (depends on Gemini API)
- **Dataset Search:** <100ms
- **Session Retrieval:** <10ms
- **Emergency Detection:** <50ms

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection:** Never commit `.env` file
2. **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated
3. **Rate Limiting:** Consider adding rate limiting in production
4. **CORS:** Configure allowed origins properly

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Session IDs:** Use unique, unpredictable session IDs
2. **Error Handling:** All endpoints have try-catch blocks
3. **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for debugging
4. **Documentation:** Keep API docs updated
